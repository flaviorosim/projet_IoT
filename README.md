📍 WiFi Sniffing & LoRaWAN GeolocationA GPS-free geolocation system that estimates the position of an ESP32 node by scanning surrounding WiFi Access Points (WiFi Sniffing), transmitting the data via LoRaWAN, and calculating the location using a Weighted Centroid algorithm based on RSSI strength.📖 Project OverviewThe goal of this project is to track the trajectory of a device in an environment where GPS is unavailable or power-hungry. The system relies on a pre-built database of known WiFi Access Points (fingerprinting/mapping) to triangulate the device's position.Key FeaturesWiFi Sniffing: Passive scanning of MAC addresses (BSSID) and Signal Strength (RSSI).LoRaWAN Communication: Long-range, low-power transmission of scanned data to The Things Network (TTN).MAC Filtering: Automatic filtering of randomized/mobile MAC addresses to ensure accuracy.Real-time Visualization: Web interface with a live map (Leaflet.js) showing the estimated trajectory.Smart Fallback: Weighted Centroid algorithm to estimate position based on signal proximity.🏗️ System ArchitectureSnippet de códigograph LR

🛠️ Technologies & HardwareHardwareMicrocontroller: ESP32 (Dev Module).Communication Module: LoRa-E5 (Grove or similar LoRaWAN modem).Software StackFirmware: C++ (Arduino IDE) with WiFi.h and AT Command handling.Network Server: The Things Network (TTN) v3.Backend: Node.js (Express, MQTT.js, CSV-Parser).Database: CSV-based Reference Database (Derived from WiGLE).Frontend: HTML5, Leaflet.js (OpenStreetMap).Utilities: Python scripts for data cleaning and database fetching.🚀 Installation & Setup1. PrerequisitesNode.js & npm installed.Python 3.x installed (for DB scripts).Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support.A The Things Network (TTN) account.2. The Reference Database The system needs to know where the WiFi routers are located.Export data from WiGLE WiFi Wardriving app (Android) or use a Python script to fetch data from the WiGLE API.Place your raw CSV file in the root folder.Run the converter script to format it for the server:Bashpython formatDB.py
This generates a clean db.csv.3. Firmware (ESP32)Open the .ino file in Arduino IDE.Update your LoRaWAN credentials:C++const char* DEV_EUI = "YOUR_DEV_EUI";
const char* APP_EUI = "0000000000000000";
const char* APP_KEY = "YOUR_APP_KEY";
Upload the code to the ESP32.4. The Things Network (TTN) ConfigurationCreate an Application and register your Device.Go to Payload Formatters > Uplink and select Custom Javascript.Paste the provided decoder script (decodes the 7-byte chunks: 6 bytes MAC + 1 byte RSSI).5. Backend Server (Node.js)Navigate to the project folder.Install dependencies:Bashnpm install mqtt express csv-parser cors
Edit server.js with your TTN Application credentials:JavaScriptconst TTN_USER = 'your-app-id';
const TTN_PASS = 'NNSXS.YOUR_API_KEY...';
Start the server:Bashnode server.js
🖥️ UsageStart the Server: Ensure node server.js is running. You should see "Connected to TTN".Open the Dashboard: Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.Power the Device: Turn on the ESP32.Visualize:The ESP32 scans WiFi networks.It filters out mobile hotspots and sends the strongest fixed APs via LoRa.TTN forwards the payload to your Node.js server via MQTT.The server matches MAC addresses against db.csv.The server calculates the estimated position and updates the map in real-time.🧮 How the Algorithm WorksWe use a Weighted Centroid approach rather than strict trilateration, as RSSI is noisy.$$Lat_{est} = \frac{\sum (Lat_i \times w_i)}{\sum w_i}, \quad Lon_{est} = \frac{\sum (Lon_i \times w_i)}{\sum w_i}$$Where the weight $w_i$ is inversely proportional to the estimated distance $d$:$$w_i = \frac{1}{d_i^{n}}$$RSSI to Distance: Calculated using the Log-Distance Path Loss Model.Result: The closer the node is to a router (stronger signal), the more "pull" that router has on the estimated position dot on the map.
